# Captain Falcon vs. Falco Matchup

## Character Overview

Captain Falcon is predominantly aerial-based, relying heavily on aerial attacks. Unlike Doctor Mario, who can use wavedash (WD) into up-tilt (utilt) / down smash (dsmash), Captain Falcon primarily relies on his grab game. However, this aerial approach becomes quite limited when facing Falco, whose high lasers disrupt Captain Falcon's dashes and short hop aerials.

### Falcon's Restricted Options Post-Laser

- Falcon's out-of-shield (OOS) options are generally weak.
- After taking a laser, Falcon's options are further diminished, often forcing him to transition from Take (T) -> Shield (S).
- Power shield (PS) options are limited, with PS -> wavedash being unviable.
- Outside of PS -> nair range, Falcon lacks threatening options.
- Nair is unsafe on shield, especially against crouch cancel (CC), being -2 on shield even when executed perfectly.

#### Aerial Engagement

- Captain Falcon cannot approach with an aerial after Falco's laser (L -> L), as doing so results in a substantial opening for Falco.
- Nair OOS, with full drift-in, covers approximately the distance of one Battlefield (BF) platform.

#### Laser Hit in Aerial State

- Upon being hit by a laser in the air, Falcon incurs normal laser stun followed by a double jump (DJ) and about 30 frames before being able to attack, or a few additional frames of falling and then 3 frames of landing lag, leaving at least 12 frames of vulnerability.

## Matchup Dynamics

The matchup is skewed in Falco's favor, not because Falcon cannot execute a nair or because Falco can win thoughtlessly by rushing in. Rather, Falco's advantage stems from his ability to force Falcon to make aggressive, often predictably desperate approaches.

### Key Strategic Reminders

- **Avoid unnecessary risks**: Attempting forced actions like a dash SH (L -> DSH -> nair) can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Capitalizing on positioning**: Unlike characters with quick options like Fox's shine or Marth's better dash, Falcon's quickest options like jab or grab aren't immediate threats. This allows for continued setup of pressure.

## Shield Laser Counterplay

### Captain Falcon's Shield Options Against Laser

- **Nair OOS**: Can trade with Falcon's nair in-place if timed extremely well. This may not necessarily be disadvantageous.
- **Wavedash back (WDB)**: Effective against an approaching nair, making it a safe choice for Falcon.
- **Full Hop (FH) -> Aerial**: Generally too slow to counter Falco's nair.

### Strategies Against Falcon in Shield

- Maintaining at least one BF platform distance ensures OOS nair cannot reach successfully.
- Shooting subsequent lasers after a short wait can catch aerial OOS or WDB, continuing pressure.
- Occasionally, overshooting with a late nair/dair (~20-30% of the time) can counter WDB or a shielding Falcon.
